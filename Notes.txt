Github Repo for the Project:

https://github.com/adrianhajdin/react_native-restate/tree/main

Downloaded the assets from this link:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HxuvAeJfiPfcZ1co5fU0ahKRw4sbA0gO/view

Copied and pasted the 'assets' folder to the root folder of the project.

Copied and pasted the 'constants' folder to the root folder of the project.

---------

The 'icon' property under the 'expo' object already points to the correct image asset in the app.json file.

Changed the filename of 'android-icon-foreground.png' to 'icon.png' for the 'foreground' property under android > adaptiveIcon object in the app.json file.

Changed the filename of 'android-icon-background.png' to 'icon.png' for the 'foreground' property under android > adaptiveIcon object in the app.json file.

Changed the filename of 'android-icon-monochrome.png' to 'icon.png' for the 'foreground' property under android > adaptiveIcon object in the app.json file.

Added an array above the 'experiments' object in the app.json file.

Modified the 'expo-splash-screen' object properties.

---------

Installed expo font with the following command:

npx expo install expo-font

Imported the fonts and modified the code in the '_layout.tsx' file.

Added fontFamily and colors properties for custom values in the tailwind.config.js file.

----------

  \         /
   `-.`-'.-'
   ,:--.--:.
  / |  |  | \
   /\  |  /\
   | `.:.' |

There is currently a bug happening with the app icon.

The given filename for the app icon and splash screen is "icon.png".

However, the default image will still be shown.

When the image filename is changed to other than that, say "real-icon.png" or "app-icon.png", the image will be shown properly on the app icon and splash screen.

----------

Created "image.d.ts" file for declaring rules for the constants.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Setup AppWrite
==============

Created a new project in AppWrite called "ReState_Mobile_App" with type "React Native".

The full app name is ReState (com.expo.restate)

---------

After creating the platform for this mobile app, AppWrite doesn't directly give you the steps to install AppWrite dependencies.

As a result, you will need to go to this documentation to continue with the setup.

https://appwrite.io/docs/quick-starts/react-native

---------

Setup Google OAuth
==================

Go to the 'Auth' section of the AppWrite platform page.

Click on 'Settings' on the menubar.

Select 'Google' and copy the URI

Go to Google Cloud through console.cloud.google.com.

Create a new project there called 'restate' and select the project after it has been created.

Search for 'google auth' in the search bar and select 'Google Auth Platform'

Click on 'Clients' section and click 'Get Started'.

Fill in the necesary information:

- App Information:
  - App name: ReState
  - User support email: (use yours or dummy email)
- Audience: External
- Contact information: (use yours or dummy email)

And click 'Finish'

NOTE: Save the displayed secret information safely in a text file or document.

---------

Click on 'Create OAuth client'

- Application Type: Web application (since it is similar to a React Native app)
- Name: (use default name)

Click on 'Add URI' and paste in the URI from AppWrite.

Click 'Create'

---------

Copy the Client ID from the newly created Google OAtuh and paste it into the App ID in AppWrite

Do the same with the Client Secret to the App Secret.

Ensure that the 'Enable' button is toggled to on.

Afterwards, it can be seen i AppWrite that Google OAuth has been enabled.

---------

Next, another platform type has to be registered to ensure the auth works.

In the current platform, AppWrite is handling the OAuth sign-in. As a result, the redirects will be of the AppWrite domain.

These redirects will then create a session for the mobile application which will redirect to the mobile app.

- Click on 'Add Platform' and choose 'Web' on the console homepage

- Choose 'React' for now.

- Fill in '*' for the Hostname

- Create the platform

----------

Copy the project ID from AppWrite console.

Created .env.local file in the root project.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Created '.env.local' file for appwrite oauth secrets.

Created a new folder 'lib' and 'appwrite.ts' file inside.

----------

It says that the 'createOAuthToken' method has been deprecated.

However, the following links still use this method with no warning whatsoever.

- https://appwrite.io/docs/products/auth/oauth2
- https://appwrite.io/blog/post/fixing-oauth2-issues-in-appwrite-cloud

Maybe the documentation has not been updated yet?

----------

All the necesary AppWrite SDK functions have been written in appwrite.ts file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Call the login function from the handleLogin function in sign-in.tsx

Created 'hook' folder to store custom hooks.

'useAppwrite.ts' custom hook contains a function that returns helpful functions to simplify fetching user data.

----------

Created 'global-provider.tsx' in lib folder in purpose of properly redirecting users.

This file serves as a global auth provider to fetch the user data (if exist) and redirect to the appropriate screen.

----------

Wrap the whole application in _layout.tsx with the global context provider.

----------

Apparently the code from the previous section are not working due to outdated AppWrite code.

Thus, the current up-to-date documentation is used instead.

https://appwrite.io/docs/products/auth/oauth2 (10/28/25)

----------

Installed expo auth session:

npx expo install expo-auth-session expo-crypto

----------

Unfortunately, an error popped up just as the user logged in with oauth as follows:

"Uncaught error java.io.IOException failed to download remote update"

Searched online for the cause and could only find the following reasons:

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE5USq9vz6w (Troubleshooting Expo Go Connection Issues: Uncaught Error & Download Failures) [Chasfat Projects]

: To check your project and phone app have aligned versions

- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79418750/reactnative-expo-failed-to-download-remote-update-over-usb

: To check your project and phone app are on the same wifi network

- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79332816/uncaught-error-java-io-ioexception-failed-to-download-remote-update (The top answer is the solution for this)

Tunneling is like calling a delivery service (the ngrok/tunneling service). You give the service your private apartment number, and they give you a temporary public locker key (the tunnel URL). Anyone can drop a package at the public locker key, and the service guarantees it gets routed securely to your private apartment.: Use tunneling to solve the issue

----------

Modified sign-in.tsx file to handle oauth login.

Created _layout.ts file under app/(root) to gracefully hide other screen tabs when the user is not logged in.

This is a special layout for the properties and tabs.

----------

Moved the properties folder to be under (root) folder which should have been done previously.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Created a _layout.tsx file under the (tabs) folder to be an exclusive layout for the three pages inside.

----------

Removed the navigation Links from the index.tsx screen.

----------

Focused on the profile screen first to complete the authentication lifecycle in enabling users to log in and log out.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Modified the code in the profile.tsx file to implement the necessary components.

----------

Logout button is placed at the bottom since it is an uncommon action by the user.

----------

The getInitials method from AppWrite is bugging, so the method has been replaced with a direct URI to the getInitials method within 'appwrite.ts'.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Modified the index.tsx file to implement the home screen UI and functionality.

----------

Created a 'components' folder under the root directory.

Created 'Search.tsx' component inside that folder.

Imported the component inside index.tsx.

----------

To optimize the search functionality by preventing search on every keypress, the use-debounce package is used.

Source: https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-debounce

Command:

npm i use-debounce

----------

Created 'Cards.tsx' in the components folder.

Created 'Filters.tsx' in the components folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: No two virtualized lists can be added in two different directions.

----------

Move the components into a flatlist component in index.tsx

----------

Card components are now rendered through flatlist component, no longer directly within the component.

Basically, flatlist is being utilized to flexibly render the scrollable components.

Notice how the content will be the scrollable recommendation section while the header is the top part which can involve another flatlist for the scrollable featured section.

----------

Real user data is now being rendered in home screen.

Modified index.tsx to implement the search functionality.

----------

Created handleCardPress function to direct the user to its detail page/screen.

Pass the item to the card since real data is being passed on now.

----------

Modified Cards.tsx to accept the item property as well as define the appropriate type for it.

----------

Created 'NoResults.tsx' to handle whenever there is no item or data to be displayed.

Use this component on the ListEmptyComponent attribute of the FlatList component.

----------

Currently, the search functionality does not work since the table rows have not been indexed yet.

Head over to the 'Indexes' tab in the AppWrite console.

- Index 1

Index Key: index_1, Index type: FullText, Attribute: name, Order: ASC

- Index 2

Index Key: index_2, Index type: FullText, Attribute: address, Order: ASC

- Index 3

Index Key: index_3, Index type: FullText, Attribute: type, Order: ASC

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Copy all the code from 'index.tsx' and overwrite the code in 'explore.tsx'.

----------

Fixed categories type values in 'data.ts' so that the filter works properly.

Implement getPropertyById function in 'appwrite.ts'.

----------

Modified the code in 'properties/[id].tsx' with the given one from the repo.

----------

Created 'Comment.tsx' file into the component folder.

----------

See the following link to include the relationship data as well when querying a single property.

Created 'Slide.tsx', 'SliderItem.tsx', 'SliderData.tsx', and 'SliderPagination.tsx'.

Installed linear gradient package by expo with the following command:

npx expo install expo-linear-gradient

----------

Installed React Native Reanimated package with the following command:

npm i react-native-reanimated

----------

----------

Created a new table called 'showcases' to store all the featured images of a property.

Create the relationship between properties and showcases tables in the properties table.

- 'showcase' table

Type: One-way, Column key: showcase, Relation: One to many, On deleting a row: Cascade

[ NOTE: AppWrite has deemed the table to already have too many columns, so this column cannot be created ]

However, the 'showcases' table would likely be seeded the same way the 'galleries' table is seeded.
